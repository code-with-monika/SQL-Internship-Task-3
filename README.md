**Task 3 – Writing Basic SQL Queries**

**Objective**

The main goal of this task is to practice SQL SELECT queries to extract, filter, and sort data from an employee table. This includes using conditions, pattern matching, and sorting to build a clear understanding of SQL data retrieval.

**Concepts Covered**

**SELECT** – retrieving all or specific columns

**WHERE**– filtering records based on conditions

**AND / OR**– combining multiple conditions

**LIKE '%value%'** – pattern matching

**BETWEEN** – filtering within ranges

**ORDER BY** – sorting results (ascending & descending)
